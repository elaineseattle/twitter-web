## Setup

Install the project dependencies

```sh
yarn
```

Build the project for the first time

```sh
cd server
yarn codegen
```

```sh
cd client
yarn codegen
```

```sh 
in home directory
yarn build
```

And finally, start the project

```sh
yarn dev
```

After the client and server build processes complete, you should see an "imitation Twitter" running on [http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234).
